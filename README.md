B1 Technologies was forged from the mastermind of Brent P. Davis, an affiliate of Texas Specialty Underwriters.
Throughout his career as an insurance agent and underwriter, he just knew there could be a better, quicker, and
more stable method of generating quotes. So with his concept in mind, he set out to hire a small development team
in order to aid in this task at hand. Brent hired Cryp70 first in which was doing 
an outstanding job. Handling 2 different sites and pushing towards nearing a production. But he needed assistance.
And so Cryp70 hired Gh0s7 in order to provide some major assistance for the development of B1 Technologies! Together, these
3 would research, develop, and release the greatest piece of software the insurance world has ever seen!
